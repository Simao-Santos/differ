A very common problem in software development is to fix something and create a new bug elsewhere for unexpected or unforeseen reasons. To ensure that this doesn’t happen too often (you can never be sure) you need to test the most common parts and actions of your website. Usually those tests are done manually by a QA team and they are very boring, repetitive and most of the times, ineffective. This project is to create a set of pages, store their output before the deployment and compare with the output after the deployment has been done. That comparison needs to be very visual and fast, sending the developer attention to unexpected changes on that set of pages. To prevent the comparison of blocks that are random a set of delimiters for those blocks should be stored against the pages or “group of pages” to remove those blocks from the comparisons. The automated testing should also be able to do a POST to a page with a set of params and also store that output, in all ways similar to what is done in the GET requests.
